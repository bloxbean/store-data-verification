# Playwright Framework

Playwright TypeScript Automation Framework

## Playwright Introduction

- Playwright is a framework for Web Testing and Automation. It allows testing Chromium, Firefox and WebKit with a single API. Playwright is built to enable cross-browser web automation that is ever-green, capable, reliable and fast. Headless execution is supported for all browsers on all platforms.
- As Playwright is written by the creators of the Puppeteer, you would find a lot of similarities between them.
- Playwright has its own test runner for end-to-end tests, we call it Playwright Test.
- Cross-browser. Playwright supports all modern rendering engines including Chromium, WebKit, and Firefox.
- Cross-platform. Test on Windows, Linux, and macOS, locally or on CI, headless or headed.
- Cross-language. Use the Playwright API in TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, .NET, Java. The core framework is implemented using TypeScript.
- Playwright development is sponsored by Microsoft.
